# 🚀 CloudTAK Infrastructure - Deployment Guide

## **Quick Start (Recommended)**

### **Prerequisites**
- AWS Account with configured credentials
- Base infrastructure stack (`TAK-<n>-BaseInfra`) deployed
- Public Route 53 hosted zone for your domain
- Node.js and npm installed
- Docker installed and running

### **One-Command Deployment**
```bash
# Install dependencies (from cdk directory)
cd cdk && npm install

# Deploy development environment
npm run deploy:dev

# Deploy production environment  
npm run deploy:prod
```

**That's it!** 🎉 The CDK deployment handles building, context configuration, and deployment.

## **📋 Environment Configurations**

| Environment | Stack Name | Domain | Features |
|-------------|------------|--------|----------|
| **dev-test** | `TAK-Dev-CloudTAK` | `map.dev.tak.nz` | Cost-optimized, Aurora Serverless v2 |
| **prod** | `TAK-Prod-CloudTAK` | `map.tak.nz` | Production-ready, Aurora Multi-AZ |

---

## **🔧 Advanced Configuration**

### **Custom Stack Deployment**
```bash
# Deploy with custom stack name
npm run deploy:dev -- --context stackName=Demo
npm run deploy:prod -- --context stackName=Enterprise
```

### **Infrastructure Preview**
```bash
# Preview changes before deployment
npm run synth:dev     # Development environment
npm run synth:prod    # Production environment

# Show what would change
npm run cdk:diff:dev  # Development diff
npm run cdk:diff:prod # Production diff
```

## **🔌 Installing CloudTAK plugins (WEB_PLUGINS)**

CloudTAK plugins are cloned into `app/plugins/` while the Docker image is built, using
the `WEB_PLUGINS` build arg. This repo sets it from CDK config.

- **Config:** `cloudtak.webPlugins` in `cdk/cdk.json`, per environment. Comma and/or
  whitespace separated `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>.git` URLs. `dev-test` installs
  the rubbersheet and weather plugins; `prod` is empty. Other URL forms (ssh, credentials, `#ref`,
  `file:`) are rejected at synth time.
- **Overrides:** `--context WebPlugins="<urls>"` (use `""` for none), then the
  `WEB_PLUGINS` environment variable, then `cdk.json`.
- **Manual deploy (Test stack):**
  ```bash
  npm run build && npm run cdk deploy -- \
    --context envType=dev-test \
    --context stackName=Demo \
    --context tak-project="TAK on AWS" \
    --context tak-component="CloudTAK" \
    --context tak-region=us-west-2 \
    --context useS3CloudTAKConfigFile=true \
    --require-approval never
  ```
  Add `--context WebPlugins="https://github.com/dfpc-coe/cloudtak-plugin-sample.git"` to
  install a different plugin set for that deploy.
- **CI:** the Demo build (`demo-build.yml`) uses the `dev-test` value and the production
  build uses the `prod` value from `cdk/cdk.json`. Pre-built images ignore
  `--context WebPlugins` at deploy time; the plugin set is fixed when the image is built.

**Gotchas**
- The clone happens after `COPY api/` and `COPY app/`, and it takes the plugin's
  **default branch** (`--depth 1`). A plugin-only change therefore does not change the
  image hash. In CI, re-run the build with `force_rebuild`. For a manual CDK deploy,
  change any file in `api/` or `app/` (or the plugin list) so the asset is rebuilt.
- The image build runs `npm run lint && npm run check` over `app/plugins/`, so a plugin
  must pass the app's lint and type checks or the build fails.
- Plugin dependencies must already be in `app/package.json` and its lockfile, because
  `npm ci` runs before plugins are cloned.
- After a deploy, users need Settings -> Refresh App to pick up the new plugin bundle.

### **Weather plugin (cloudtak-plugin-weather)**
Adds a weather button under the 3D terrain button in the map's left controls; it opens a bottom
bar with rain, global rain, cloud and radar layers and a forecast slider. Tiles come from the weather-proxy through a CloudTAK API relay
(`/api/weather`), so browsers never see the proxy URL or key.

| Variable | Required | Rule |
|----------|----------|------|
| `WEATHER_PROXY_URL` | Yes | `https` URL, no query, fragment or credentials; a trailing slash is stripped |
| `WEATHER_PROXY_KEY` | Yes | Characters `[A-Za-z0-9._~-]`, 16 to 128 long |
| `WEATHER_RATE_LIMIT` | No | Tile requests per user per minute, 60 to 6000, default 900 |

- **Where:** the variables live in `s3://<config bucket>/cloudtak-config.env` (see
  `cloudtak-config.env.example`) and only apply with `--context useS3CloudTAKConfigFile=true`.
  The `dev-test` default in `cdk.json` is `false`. The manual deploy command above already
  sets it.
- **Helper script:** `scripts/set-weather-proxy-config.sh` sets the variables in that file
  (see below).
- **Upstream limits:** each API task makes at most 500 weather-proxy fetches a minute (the
  proxy allows 600 per client IP). After a 429 from the proxy the task pauses upstream fetches
  for 5 to 120 s; cached tiles are still served and uncached tiles get `429` with `Retry-After`.
- **Tile formats:** tiles are PNG, except `clouds` tiles, which are WebP. The relay detects the
  format from the image bytes and sets the `Content-Type`, so no weather-proxy change is needed.
- **Restart:** values are read at request time but injected when the task starts. After
  changing the file, deploy or run `aws ecs update-service --force-new-deployment` so a new
  task picks them up.
- **Test values:** `WEATHER_PROXY_URL=https://utils.test.tak.nz/weather-radar`.
- **Key:** add a dedicated client entry to the weather-proxy key file with
  `providers: ["rainbow"]` and a rate limit sized for the relay. Never reuse another
  consumer's key.
- **Check:** after deploy, `curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" https://map.test.tak.nz/api/weather/status`
  should return `"enabled":true`.
- **Rebuild:** the plugin is cloned from the default branch of
  `TAK-NZ/cloudtak-plugin-weather`, so plugin changes need an image rebuild (CI
  `force_rebuild`, or change a file under `api/` or `app/` before a manual CDK deploy).
- **Users:** Settings -> Refresh App after the deploy.

#### Setting the weather variables with the helper script
`scripts/set-weather-proxy-config.sh` replaces `WEATHER_PROXY_URL`, `WEATHER_PROXY_KEY` and
(optionally) `WEATHER_RATE_LIMIT` in `s3://<config bucket>/cloudtak-config.env`. The bucket is
resolved from the export `TAK-<stack name>-BaseInfra-EnvConfigBucket` (stack name `Demo` by
default). Every other line of the file is kept as it is. The three variables are written as one
block between `# BEGIN weather-proxy (managed by ...)` and `# END weather-proxy`, so running it
again changes nothing.

1. Put the key alone in a file that only you can read, for example
   `install -m 600 /dev/null ~/weather.key` and then paste the key into it. The script refuses
   a key file with a mode other than 600 or 400. Without `--key-file` it asks for the key with a
   hidden prompt.
2. Run a dry run first. It downloads the file, writes the backup and shows the change, but
   uploads nothing.

   ```bash
   # Test (profile default, region us-west-2)
   scripts/set-weather-proxy-config.sh --profile default --region us-west-2 \
       --url https://utils.test.tak.nz/weather-radar --key-file ~/weather.key --dry-run

   # Demo (profile tak-nz-demo, region ap-southeast-2)
   scripts/set-weather-proxy-config.sh --profile tak-nz-demo --region ap-southeast-2 \
       --url https://utils.test.tak.nz/weather-radar --key-file ~/weather.key --dry-run
   ```
3. Remove `--dry-run` to upload. The script asks for confirmation unless `--yes` is given, then
   downloads the file again and checks that exactly the `WEATHER_*` names are present and the
   other lines are unchanged.
4. Start a new deployment. The script does not do it; it prints the command:
   `aws --profile <profile> --region <region> ecs update-service --cluster TAK-<stack>-BaseInfra --service TAK-<stack>-CloudTAK --force-new-deployment`.

- **Backup:** the config buckets are not versioned (Test never enabled it, Demo suspended it),
  so the script first saves the current file as
  `~/.cloudtak-config-backups/<account>-<region>-<UTC time>.env` (directory mode 700, file mode
  600). To undo a change, copy that file back with `aws s3 cp`.
- **Key handling:** the key is never printed or logged and is not part of any command line or
  environment. It only exists in the key file and in a private temporary file that is deleted at
  exit. A later backup contains the key of an earlier run, so keep the backup directory private.
- **Options:** `--rate N` also sets `WEATHER_RATE_LIMIT` (without it an existing
  `WEATHER_RATE_LIMIT` line is removed and the default of 900 applies), `--stack-name` and
  `--bucket` select another stack or bucket, `--help` lists everything.
- **Key format:** the script accepts 16 to 256 characters of `A-Za-z0-9._~+/=-` but warns when
  the key is outside what the relay accepts (`A-Za-z0-9._~-`, 16 to 128), because the relay
  would then stay disabled.

## **🚀 First-Time Setup**

### **Prerequisites**
1. **AWS Account** with appropriate permissions
2. **Base Infrastructure** deployed (`TAK-<n>-BaseInfra`)
3. **Node.js** and npm installed  
4. **AWS CLI** configured with credentials
5. **Docker** installed and running

### **Initial Setup Steps**
```bash
# 1. Clone and install
git clone <repository-url>
cd CloudTAK/cdk
npm install

# 2. Set environment variables (if using AWS profiles)
export CDK_DEFAULT_ACCOUNT=$(aws sts get-caller-identity --query Account --output text --profile your-profile)
export CDK_DEFAULT_REGION=$(aws configure get region --profile your-profile)

# 3. Deploy CloudTAK infrastructure
npm run deploy:dev -- --context stackName=YourStackName
```

## **🔄 Environment Transformation**

### **Switching Between Environment Types**

You can transform deployed environments between different configuration profiles (dev-test ↔ prod) without recreating resources from scratch.

### **Initial Deployment with Custom Configuration**
```bash
# Deploy a demo environment with dev-test configuration
npm run deploy:dev -- --context stackName=Demo
```

### **Environment Upgrade (dev-test → prod)**
```bash
# Transform to production configuration
npm run deploy:prod -- --context stackName=Demo
```

### **Environment Downgrade (prod → dev-test)**
```bash
# Scale back to development configuration
npm run deploy:dev -- --context stackName=Demo
```

---

## **🛠️ Troubleshooting**

### **Common Issues**

#### **Missing Base Infrastructure**
```
Error: Cannot import value TAK-Demo-BaseInfra-VPC-ID
```
**Solution:** Ensure base infrastructure stack is deployed first.

#### **Docker Build Issues**
```
Error: Docker build failed
```
**Solution:** Ensure Docker is running and the Dockerfiles exist (`Dockerfile` at the repository root, and `tasks/*/Dockerfile`).

### **Debug Commands**
```bash
# Check what would be deployed
npm run synth:dev
npm run synth:prod

# See differences from current state
npm run cdk:diff:dev
npm run cdk:diff:prod

# View CloudFormation events
aws cloudformation describe-stack-events --stack-name TAK-Dev-CloudTAK
```

---

## **📊 Post-Deployment**

### **Verify Deployment**
```bash
# Check stack status
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name TAK-Dev-CloudTAK

# View outputs
aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name TAK-Dev-CloudTAK \
  --query 'Stacks[0].Outputs'
```

### **Access Services**
- **CloudTAK Web Interface**: `https://map.{domain}`
- **CloudTAK API**: `https://map.{domain}/api`
- **ETL Tasks**: Managed via ECS console

### **Cleanup**
```bash
# Destroy development environment
npx cdk destroy --context envType=dev-test

# Destroy production environment (use with caution!)
npx cdk destroy --context envType=prod
```
